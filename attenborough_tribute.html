      Sir David Attenborough has long been the most recognizable         advocates for all nature and wildlife around the world for         decades. His documentaries have shown millions of people so       much of the ecosystems across the planet, from the frigid         polar regions to the teeming life of the rainforests.
      In his most recent documentary he has shown the incredibly         destructive effect mankind has had on wildlife diversity and       how we have contributed to climate change over the time he         has been filming nature on Earth.
